# The World of Batatune II

Batatune II is the second moon of Drogiphus, the sixth farthest planet from the sun. Batatune II is a lush moon full of wonder and magic, as well as terrifying monsters.
Due to the nature of the monsters that arise to cause chaos and evil, heroes emerge to stop their rampages. Powerful mages, champion fighters, devoute clerics, and trickster rogues work together to stop forces of evil.

## The Story so far...

Life on Batatune II has been peaceful until recently. When the Dragon Lord, a powerful demon with the abilities to bend dragons to his will appeared, no one could stop him. He now rules over most of Batatune II and continues to seek total conquest. No heroes have been able to surpass the power of the Dragon Lord and his minions, but heroes still rise all the same. Will you step up to the challenge? Will you defeat the Dragon Lord before all of Batatune II falls under his dominion?
